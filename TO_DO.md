# TO DO:

* find python library for linux support 
  * pyautogui doesn't support linux, so i'll have to find another library to detect open windows for linux. 
* add launch script for windows? unsure if keyboard requires admin on windows, i suspect it doesn't, but a launch script might be useful. 
* make README.md more concise
